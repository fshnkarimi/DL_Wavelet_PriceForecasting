### Financial time series forecasting models:
- ARIMA(Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average): a statistical method
- LSTM(Long short-term memory): an artificial recurrent neural network architecture used in the field of deep learning
- GRU(Gated Recurrent Unit): a new generation of Neural Networks and is similar to Long Short Term Memory (LSTM).
- DNN(Deep Neural Networks): a neural network with some level of complexity, usually at least two layers
